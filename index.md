# Research Experience
Currently, I'm doing research at [Thinklab](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

For my research interests, I am broadly interested in various research topics in machine learning, including representation learning, robust learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. In particular, my current research focus on graph structured data (GNNs), building models with enough expressiveness, scalability and generalizability to solve real problems. For some of my previous experience:
-  Quantum Machine Learning<br /> <p align='right'>2020.09 - 2021.04</p>
-  Neural Relational Inference for Multi-dimensional Temporal Point Processes via GNNs<br /> <p align='right'>2021.06 - 2021.08</p>
-  On Adversarial Attack and Defense for Combinatorial Optimization (submitted to ICLR'22)<br /> <p align='right'>2021.08 - Present</p>
-  A Scalable Structure Learning Approach for GNNs (submitted to ICML'22)<br /> <p align='right'>2021.10 - Present</p>
-  On Collective Robustness of Bagging Against Data Poisoning<br /><p align='right'>2021.12 - Present</p>

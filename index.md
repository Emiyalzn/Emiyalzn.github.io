# Research Experience
Currently, I'm doing research at [Thinklab](https://thinklab.sjtu.edu.cn) under the supervision of [Prof. Junchi Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ga230VoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

For my research interests, I am broadly interested in various research topics in machine learning, including representation learning, robust learning, combinatorial optimization, etc. In particular, my current research focus on **graph structured data (GNNs)**, building models with enough expressiveness, scalability and generalizability to solve real problems. For some of my previous experience:
-  Quantum Machine Learning (2020.09 - 2021.04)
-  Neural Relational Inference for Multi-dimensional Temporal Point Processes via GNNs (2021.06 - 2021.08)
-  On Adversarial Attack and Defense for Combinatorial Optimization (submitted to ICLR'22, 2021.08 - Present)
-  A Scalable Structure Learning Approach for GNNs (submitted to ICML'22, 2021.10 - Present)
-  On Collective Robustness of Bagging Against Data Poisoning (submitted to ICML'22, 2021.12 - Present)

# Selected Awards
